## What it does

Type a domain. Press Enter. Within seconds you know:

- **TLS** — certificate chain trust, expiry, algorithm strength, OCSP stapling, CT logs, forward secrecy
- **DNS** — SPF, DMARC, DKIM, MTA-STS, DNSSEC, CAA, MX configuration, lint findings
- **IP reputation** — every resolved address classified: residential, datacenter, VPN, Tor, botnet C2

All three checks run in parallel. Results stream in as each backend responds — no spinner, no wait-and-dump. The page comes alive progressively. A weighted aggregate produces an **A+–F grade** with per-section breakdowns and hard-fail overrides for baseline security requirements.

## Try it

**Browser** — [lens.netray.info](https://lens.netray.info)

**Terminal:**
```sh
# SSE stream (results arrive as they complete)
curl -N 'https://lens.netray.info/api/check/example.com'

# Single JSON response — better for scripts and LLMs
curl -s -H 'Accept: application/json' 'https://lens.netray.info/api/check/example.com' | jq .
```

**Shareable link:** `https://lens.netray.info/?d=yourdomain.com`

## Use with Claude

lens has first-class Claude integration via MCP. Once installed, you can ask Claude to check domain health directly in any conversation — no copy-pasting `curl` output, no manual JSON parsing.

![API Docs](docs/screenshots/api-docs.png)

### Install the MCP server

**Claude Code** — run this skill from the lens repo directory:

```sh
/lens-mcp-code
```

The skill writes `~/.claude/mcp-servers/lens/server.mjs`, installs dependencies, and registers the server with `claude mcp add`. Requires Node.js ≥ 18.

**Claude Desktop** — same skill, different registration target:

```sh
/lens-mcp-desktop
```

Edits `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` automatically. Restart Claude Desktop after the skill completes.

### Available tools

| Tool | What it does |
|---|---|
| `check_domain` | Full DNS + TLS + IP check for one domain — structured JSON with grade, scores, hard-fail details |
| `check_domains` | Check up to 10 domains sequentially — per-domain results, errors captured per-entry |
| `lens_meta` | Server metadata: version, backends, scoring profile, rate limits |

### Usage examples

Once installed, ask Claude things like:

> *"Check the domain health of example.com — is anything hard-failing?"*

> *"Check these three domains and compare their TLS grades: example.com, example.org, example.net"*

> *"My deploy is failing the health gate. Check example.com and tell me what's causing the F grade."*

## API

### Check a domain

```
GET  /api/check/{domain}
POST /api/check          {"domain": "example.com"}
```

**Default output: SSE stream.** Set `Accept: application/json`, `?stream=false`, or `"stream": false` in the POST body to get a single merged JSON object (sync mode).

```sh
# SSE — events stream in as backends respond
curl -N 'https://lens.netray.info/api/check/example.com'

# Sync — one JSON object, all sections merged
curl -s 'https://lens.netray.info/api/check/example.com?stream=false'
curl -s -H 'Accept: application/json' 'https://lens.netray.info/api/check/example.com'
curl -s -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"domain":"example.com","stream":false}' \
  'https://lens.netray.info/api/check'
```

#### SSE events

| Event | Payload |
|---|---|
| `dns` | DNS findings, resolved IPs, per-check results |
| `tls` | Certificate chain, quality checks, grade |
| `ip` | Per-IP classification: network type, ASN, geo |
| `summary` | Overall grade, score, section grades, `hard_fail`, `hard_fail_reason` |
| `done` | Domain, duration_ms, cached flag |

#### Sync response

```json
{
  "dns":     { "status": "ok", "findings": [...], "resolved_ips": [...] },
  "tls":     { "status": "ok", "checks": [...], "grade": "A" },
  "ip":      { "status": "ok", "ips": [...] },
  "summary": {
    "overall": "A", "grade": "A", "score": 87.0,
    "hard_fail": false, "hard_fail_reason": null,
    "sections": { "dns": "B", "tls": "A", "ip": "A+" }
  },
  "done": { "domain": "example.com", "duration_ms": 412, "cached": false }
}
```

`hard_fail_reason` is a human-readable string when `hard_fail` is `true` (e.g. `"SPF Record, Chain of Trust"`), otherwise `null`.

#### Caching

Results are cached for 5 minutes. Cache hits return `X-Cache: HIT` and complete in milliseconds.

### Other endpoints

| Endpoint | Description |
|---|---|
| `GET /api/meta` | Server version, backends, scoring profile, rate limits |
| `GET /health` | Liveness probe |
| `GET /ready` | Readiness probe |
| `GET /api-docs/openapi.json` | OpenAPI 3.1 spec |
| `GET /docs` | Interactive API docs (Scalar UI) |

### CI / Pipeline integration

Gate deploys on domain health — if the grade drops below B, fail the build:

```yaml
- name: Domain health check
  run: |
    curl -sf -H 'Accept: application/json' \
      "https://lens.netray.info/api/check/$DOMAIN" \
    | jq -e '.summary.grade | test("^(A|B)")'
```

Or pull structured data for reporting:

```sh
curl -s -H 'Accept: application/json' 'https://lens.netray.info/api/check/example.com' \
  | jq '{grade: .summary.grade, score: .summary.score, hard_fail: .summary.hard_fail_reason}'
```

## Scoring

This section is the authoritative description of the scoring algorithm. Any change to `src/scoring/` must update this section in the same commit.

### Algorithm

Each backend returns a set of named checks. Every check has a status: `pass`, `warn`, `fail`, `not_found`, `skip`, or `error`.

1. **Per-check score**: `pass` = full weight, `warn` = half weight, `fail`/`not_found` = 0. `skip` and `error` are excluded entirely.
2. **Section score**: weighted sum of earned points ÷ weighted sum of possible points, as a percentage.
3. **Overall score**: weighted average of section scores.
4. **Hard-fail overrides**: certain failures force the overall grade to **F** regardless of the numeric score.
5. **Letter grade**: score mapped to thresholds.

### Section weights

| Section | Weight | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| TLS | 45% | Certificate validity and transport security are foundational |
| DNS | 35% | Email authentication and DNS health have major deliverability impact |
| IP | 20% | Reputation informs risk but is beyond the domain owner's direct control |

### Grade thresholds

| Grade | Score | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| A+ | ≥ 97% | Exemplary — all checks pass |
| A  | ≥ 90% | Excellent — minor gaps only |
| B  | ≥ 75% | Good — some non-critical findings |
| C  | ≥ 60% | Fair — notable gaps, action recommended |
| D  | ≥ 40% | Poor — significant issues present |
| F  | < 40% | Failing — or hard-fail override triggered |

### Hard failures

These conditions force an **F** regardless of the numeric score:

| Condition | Why |
|---|---|
| Untrusted TLS chain | Certificate not signed by a trusted CA — browsers reject it |
| Expired certificate | Any certificate in the chain |
| No SPF record | Missing entirely (not misconfigured) |
| No DMARC record | Missing entirely |

### Check weight tiers

| Weight | Meaning |
|---|---|
| 10 | Security-critical — failure has immediate, severe consequences |
| 5  | Important — strongly recommended by standards or best practice |
| 3  | Significant — meaningful impact on deliverability or security posture |
| 2  | Advisory — good practice, but failure is not operationally harmful |
| 1  | Informational — low-cost improvement opportunity |

### Custom profiles

The scoring profile is defined in TOML. The default is embedded in the binary; override it with `scoring.profile_path` in `lens.toml`.

<details>
<summary>Profile format (v2)</summary>

```toml
[meta]
name = "default"
version = 2

[sections.tls]
weight = 45
hard_fail = ["chain_trusted", "not_expired"]

[sections.tls.checks]
chain_trusted    = 10
not_expired      = 10
hostname_match   = 10
chain_complete   = 5
strong_signature = 5
key_strength     = 5

## Configuration

```sh
cp lens.example.toml lens.toml
```

```toml
[server]
bind = "0.0.0.0:8082"
metrics_bind = "127.0.0.1:9090"
# trusted_proxies = ["10.0.0.0/8"]

[backends]
dns_url = "https://dns.netray.info"
tls_url = "https://tls.netray.info"
ip_url  = "https://ip.netray.info"
# backend_timeout_secs = 20

[cache]
enabled = true
ttl_seconds = 300

[rate_limit]
per_ip_per_minute = 10
per_ip_burst = 3
global_per_minute = 100
global_burst = 20

[scoring]
# profile_path = "profiles/default.toml"   # override built-in default
```

Override any value with environment variables: `LENS_` prefix, `__` for nesting — e.g. `LENS_SERVER__BIND=0.0.0.0:8082`.

## Building

Prerequisites: Rust toolchain, Node.js (for the frontend).

```sh
make          # frontend + release binary
make dev      # cargo run (hot-reloads nothing, but starts quickly)
make test     # Rust unit + integration tests + frontend tests
make ci       # full gate: fmt, clippy, test, frontend build, audit

# Two-terminal dev workflow
make frontend-dev   # Vite dev server on :5174 (proxies /api/* to :8082)
make dev            # cargo run on :8082
```

The release binary embeds the compiled frontend — no separate static file hosting required.
